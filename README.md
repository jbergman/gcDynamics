# gcDynamics

This repository contains datasets derived from existing data sources (described in the next section) and scripts needed to reproduce the results from "Population dynamics of GC-changing mutations in humans and great apes" by [Bergman and Schierup (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.25.313411).

## Data
The SNP data of human populations are from the [1000 Genomes Project (2015)](https://www.internationalgenome.org/) and the corresponding recombination maps from [Spence and Song (2019)](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/10/eaaw9206). The SNP for the Icelandic population (ISL) were taken from [JoÃÅnsson et al. (2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24018) and the recombination maps from [Halldorsson et al. (2019)](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6425/eaau1043.editor-summary).
