# gcDynamics

This repository contains datasets derived from existing data sources (described in the next section) and scripts needed to reproduce the results from "Population dynamics of GC-changing mutations in humans and great apes" by [Bergman and Schierup (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.25.313411).

## Data
The SNP data of human populations are from the [1000 Genomes Project (2015)](https://www.internationalgenome.org/) and the corresponding recombination maps from [Spence and Song (2019)](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/10/eaaw9206). The SNP data of the Icelandic population were taken from [JoÃÅnsson et al. (2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24018) and the recombination maps from [Halldorsson et al. (2019)](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6425/eaau1043.editor-summary). The great ape SNP data and recombination maps were derived from four different sequencing studies ([Prado-Martinez et al. 2013](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12228); [Xue et al. 2015](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6231/242.long); [de Manuel et al. 2016](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6311/477); [Nater et al. 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982217312459)). Every R file is named according to the figures in the manuscript, except for the caclulateB.R file, which contains the B estimation protocol based on [Vogl and Bergman 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040580915001045?via%3Dihub).
